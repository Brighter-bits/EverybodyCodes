I have recently learnt that AOC will be having only 12 days this year and no global leaderboard... I am sad, I enjoyed waking up a stupid times to try and get a good score on the leaderboard. However, I
understand that the global leaderboard was sort of corrupted by AI, and making a puzzle is really difficult.

I guess EC will have to fill this hole in my heart.

# Day 1

A fun first quest, I did it quite quickly and had little trouble, I'm going to make the code a bit prettier though. And I did waste about two minutes because I hadn't incremented to the next part on the third
part.

Also, I'm actually really enjoying the theme and it's only been one day. Hopefully it's not dijkstra, dijkstra, dijkstra like last year.
