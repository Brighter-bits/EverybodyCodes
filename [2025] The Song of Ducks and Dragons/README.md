I have recently learnt that AOC will be having only 12 days this year and no global leaderboard... I am sad, I enjoyed waking up a stupid times to try and get a good score on the leaderboard. However, I
understand that the global leaderboard was sort of corrupted by AI, and making a puzzle is really difficult.

I guess EC will have to fill this hole in my heart.

# Day 1

A fun first quest, I did it quite quickly and had little trouble, I'm going to make the code a bit prettier though. And I did waste about two minutes because I hadn't incremented to the next part on the third
part.

Also, I'm actually really enjoying the theme and it's only been one day. Hopefully it's not dijkstra, dijkstra, dijkstra like last year.

# Day 2

I fell off hard here. I was doing great on an INCREDIBLY EASY PUZZLE. But then... disaster struck... I spent precious minutes losing 6 engravings off of the test input. It turns out, that when you floor a
negative fractional number, instead of just ignoring the fraction, it goes to the number below it...

It makes sense, but I'm still a bit annoyed that I could have just used a single different function and would have done way better. I guess this is how you learn. I'M COMING FOR YOU TONYA!!! (For reference,
this is the person now heading the UK, I **will** win... just give me time... maybe... unless the next puzzles are really difficult... then maybe not...)
