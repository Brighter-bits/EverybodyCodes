I have recently learnt that AOC will be having only 12 days this year and no global leaderboard... I am sad, I enjoyed waking up a stupid times to try and get a good score on the leaderboard. However, I
understand that the global leaderboard was sort of corrupted by AI, and making a puzzle is really difficult.

I guess EC will have to fill this hole in my heart.
