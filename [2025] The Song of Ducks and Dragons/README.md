I have recently learnt that AOC will be having only 12 days this year and no global leaderboard... I am sad, I enjoyed waking up a stupid times to try and get a good score on the leaderboard. However, I
understand that the global leaderboard was sort of corrupted by AI, and making a puzzle is really difficult.

I guess EC will have to fill this hole in my heart.

# Day 1

A fun first quest, I did it quite quickly and had little trouble, I'm going to make the code a bit prettier though. And I did waste about two minutes because I hadn't incremented to the next part on the third
part.

Also, I'm actually really enjoying the theme and it's only been one day. Hopefully it's not dijkstra, dijkstra, dijkstra like last year.

# Day 2

I fell off hard here. I was doing great on an INCREDIBLY EASY PUZZLE. But then... disaster struck... I spent precious minutes losing 6 engravings off of the test input. It turns out, that when you floor a
negative fractional number, instead of just ignoring the fraction, it goes to the number below it...

It makes sense, but I'm still a bit annoyed that I could have just used a single different function and would have done way better. I guess this is how you learn. I'M COMING FOR YOU TONYA!!! (For reference,
this is the person now heading the UK, I **will** win... just give me time... maybe... unless the next puzzles are really difficult... then maybe not...)


# Day 3

Wow, I was clearly very tired yesterday, because I didn't even make the code spit out every single part correctly.

Another easy one, either I've gotten better, or the challenges are easier than last year. For the sake of my ego, I have decided it's the former. Once I understood what was going on, it was quite easy to
handle.


# Day 4

Geeze, I'm so sleepy that I can't do basic maths... This took me far longer than it should have, mostly because for my differences I kept finding the difference between the first and second numbers, over and
over and over, instead of finding the proper differences across the entire list.

Do not code while sleepy, bad idea.

# Day 5

Oops, got distracted by a pokemon game... probably not a good day to do that on, given this day was pretty challenging. I think it was a really unique puzzle, and I actually really enjoyed doing it. I didn't
have any headbanging errors, just a few that I managed to rubber duck my way through. Overall, nice and fun.

Oh my god, how do people do this puzzle that fast?? Ahhh, so, since all the SecondOrder items are going to have the same number of levels, you can just have a list of [quality, first level, second level, ..., id].
Instead of doing whatever the hell I just did. Touché, but now I've been knocked down once again. I must reclaim my throne (unlikely as it is, as stuff only gets harder from here.)
