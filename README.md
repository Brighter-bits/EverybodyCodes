# EverybodyCodes
A horrendous EverybodyCodes repo, because I'm having withdrawal symptoms from AOC


# Day 1

Yes, starting from day 1, I know. Anyway, first bit is just counting the number of chars of each type. I may have been procrastinating on this, so the timer says I took several days to think up the solution.
I didn't.

# Oh right, I was supposed to be documenting this

# Day 2

A bit of a pain, its just a wordsearch at the end of the day though

# Day 3

Really like this puzzle actually, it forced me to do some interesting stuff with functions.

# Day 4

Easy. So easy, did it in under 10 mins. And even then, the I mistyped the input and so had to wait a minute to put in the correct answer.

There, caught up.

# Day 5

What is this?????????
