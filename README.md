A horrendous EverybodyCodes repo, because I'm having withdrawal symptoms from AOC


# Day 1

Yes, starting from day 1, I know. Anyway, first bit is just counting the number of chars of each type. I may have been procrastinating on this, so the timer says I took several days to think up the solution.
I didn't.

# Oh right, I was supposed to be documenting this

# Day 2

A bit of a pain, its just a wordsearch at the end of the day though

# Day 3

Really like this puzzle actually, it forced me to do some interesting stuff with functions.

# Day 4

Easy. So easy, did it in under 10 mins. And even then, the I mistyped the input and so had to wait a minute to put in the correct answer.

There, caught up.

# Day 5

What is this?????????

The most annoying part is when the dancer wraps around to the other column, but then if the last column wraps around to the start, everything breaks...

I swear this is impossible, every single time one of the columns just empties, how did I even do part one.

........................ Okay. So, when the clapper goes to the next column, they don't switch to the next one once they get to the end.
The clapper just circles the exact same column multiple times until they are assimilated into the hivemind.

I am very annoyed.

Okay, part 3... There's almost certainly a mathematical pattern, where it all begins to repeat. However, checking if it's repeating will probably cause a memory error. So instead, we'll just go on for a long
time and then use the largest one, and hope it's right

# Day 6

DIJKSTRA!!!!

Okay, maybe it's a bit overkill for Dijkstra. However, it's always good to practice. However, the algorithm can't differentiate between each different apple, so I've each a unique AppleID!

Okay, while implementing dijkstra may have taken some time, it obliterated parts 2 and 3, so I think it was worth it.

Cleaned up the code a bit so that I don't have to manually look at the length of each branch.

# Day 7

It doesn't look like Dijkstra... yet.

First bit was fine, the dictionary may not have been necessary though. 

Part 2 looks more complicated, but it's just applying a mask over another list.


I completely forgot that powers can't go negative, I have wasted hours on trying to find the error...
But I did see some other person's code which had some really funky cool stuff, that I actually kind of understand now (didn't help my solution though).

Pre-emptive celebration, that did not change my output.....

It's too late at night, I'm calling in the AId.

The AId is being useless, again... AI truly is the future.

I believe I now know, still need to implement it however. Every time I completed a lap, I went back to the start of the plan, what I probably should have done, is gone to the next part instead.

Brute force 4ever!!!!!!

I can't read. I've brute forced twice, 26 hours in total. Just to realise it's only those which contain 5 "+"s, 3 "-"s and 3 "="s
