A horrendous EverybodyCodes repo, because I'm having withdrawal symptoms from AOC


# Day 1

Yes, starting from day 1, I know. Anyway, first bit is just counting the number of chars of each type. I may have been procrastinating on this, so the timer says I took several days to think up the solution.
I didn't.

# Oh right, I was supposed to be documenting this

# Day 2

A bit of a pain, its just a wordsearch at the end of the day though

# Day 3

Really like this puzzle actually, it forced me to do some interesting stuff with functions.

# Day 4

Easy. So easy, did it in under 10 mins. And even then, the I mistyped the input and so had to wait a minute to put in the correct answer.

There, caught up.

# Day 5

What is this?????????

The most annoying part is when the dancer wraps around to the other column, but then if the last column wraps around to the start, everything breaks...

I swear this is impossible, every single time one of the columns just empties, how did I even do part one.

........................ Okay. So, when the clapper goes to the next column, they don't switch to the next one once they get to the end.
The clapper just circles the exact same column multiple times until they are assimilated into the hivemind.

I am very annoyed.
