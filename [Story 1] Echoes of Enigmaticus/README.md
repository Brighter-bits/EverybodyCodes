I did this quite a while ago, so this ReadME probably won't be helpful or useful to anyone.

# Day 1 (I don't know why I called them days, I did the first two in a couple hours and the last one over two days)

This was perfectly fine.

# Day 2

I had to properly learn what a tree was to make a data-structure for it, but now I know what a tree is. This was quite a fun one.

# Day 3

Absolutely disgusting. My solution technically works, yes, but only through brute forcing, hours of running and a lot of trial and error.

It does however, seem to be broken for Part 2.
